# Tom_and_Jerry-Game-Practice
A simple Tom and Jerry game in Java, player can play as Jerry to run away from Tom and eat the cheese
The idea of this project was inspired by the previous assignment in school and the legendary helping hand of Bro Code's videos on Youtube.

Tom will move automatically to catch Jerry, when they are collided together, Jerry will lose 1 life and then they will respawn in there initial places.
